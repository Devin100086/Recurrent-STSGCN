Pytorch implementation of the paper: ["Spatial-Temporal Synchronous Graph Convolutional Networks: A New Framework for Spatial-Temporal Network Data Forecasting"](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/5438).

## Introduction
This is an artificial intelligence homework in my junior year. It mainly uses the pytorch framework to reproduce the code of this paper. Through this homework, I have deepened my understanding and knowledge of graph neural networks and greatly improved my coding ability.

## TODO
Since this was a major assignment I did a year ago, there may be many details that I have forgotten. If I have time later, I will try my best to provide detailed official documentation.
